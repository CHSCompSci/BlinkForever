BlinkForever
============

BlinkForever is a basic project we're using for the Colonia High School Computer Science Club, to transition from Java into Arduino and iOS development.

This project allows the Arduino code (.ino) to tell the Arduino to flash its LED light 100 times. 




Technical Terms
============

BlinkForever was compiled on the Ardunio Uno R3.

The project has a for-loop that the Arduino compiles as turning the light on, and turning it off right after, as long as the 'i' integer is under 101 (100 would be the last integer before 101). 

The project works on most Arduino Unos, so have fun hacking!
